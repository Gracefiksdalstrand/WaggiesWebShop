			  <em>We have chosen two fonts with great care to maximize readability and aesthetic appeal for our website, Posts, and documents as a whole. Montserrat Classic is our main font selection; We chose this because of its classic elegance and adaptability. Its sleek design and simple lines make it ideal for successfully communicating our brand message. Crimson Pro was our choice for a backup typeface. We think that this decision perfectly harmonizes with Montserrat Classic, giving our viewers a better overall visual experience. Crimson Pro is a great partner typeface because of its subtle elegance and readability, which ensure harmony and uniformity across our material.</em>
            <li><strong>User interface patterns: </strong> </li>
			  <em>We used grids and carousels to make things clearer. We have set up a navigation bar with clear and short words directing our website visitors to their preferred website as smoothly as possible. To make this even easier we also have a search icon located in the bar. Being on the home page immediately shows you a hero banner. With this, we aim to immediately grab the visitors' attention. <br><br>Underneath this hero banner, we use variations of card layouts in a carousel. With this, we want to put our information in bite-size pieces for the viewers to now overwhelm them and still inform them about our brand and its ambassadors, products, and viewpoints. <br><br>On every page, the navigation bar stays the same together with the footer. In the footer, we want to remind the viewer of important information like contact information, where we are located, a CTA button to sign up for our newsletter, and useful social media (Instagram). We made sure this was consistent for the whole website for a cohesive user experience. For signing up with the newsletter we tried to make it as easy as possible for the viewer to sign up by having a text box to type the email in with a button underneath to make the steps as small as possible which will hopefully result in a higher percentage of people finishing this ‘task’<br><br>Across the whole website, we have made use of the ‘hover effect’ making the words or elements change color when hovering over it with the curser. We hope that this effect creates a more intuitive experience for our visitors while also giving more visual feedback which will create more engagement while also contributing to the aesthetics. <br>We also have responsive designs that make it easy for the user to change the width and height of the website or use it on a phone, for instance, on the standard websites three products are displayed next to each other. While on the phone these are underneath each other and you have to scroll down to see them all.<br><br>We also have implemented multiple feedback mechanisms on our website. We did this by giving people confirmation messages when they contact us or when they signed up for the newsletter. With these feedback mechanisms, we hope to provide the confirmation that will cause people to feel confident while using our website.<br><br>We organized our content intuitively and naturally by making use of a very familiar layout for websites. Also, we used headings and subheadings that should make navigating and reading through our website easier. With this, we created categories, which gave us the possibility to put more than one topic on our home/index page.
