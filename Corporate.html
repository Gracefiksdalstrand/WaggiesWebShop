              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Font choices:</strong></li>
		    We have chosen two fonts with great care to maximize readability and aesthetic appeal for our website, Posts, and documents as a whole. Montserrat Classic is our main font selection; We chose this because of its classic elegance and adaptability. Its sleek design and simple lines make it ideal for successfully communicating our brand message. Crimson Pro was our choice for a backup typeface. We think that this decision perfectly harmonizes with Montserrat Classic, giving our viewers a better overall visual experience. Crimson Pro is a great partner typeface because of its subtle elegance and readability, which ensure harmony and uniformity across our material<em>.</em>
<li><strong>User interface patterns: </strong> </li>
		    We used grids and carousels to make things clearer. We have set up a navigation bar with clear and short words directing our website visitors to their preferred website as smoothly as possible. To make this even easier we also have a search icon located in the bar. Being on the home page immediately shows you a hero banner. With this, we aim to immediately grab the visitors' attention. <br>
		    <br>
		    Underneath this hero banner, we use variations of card layouts in a carousel. With this, we want to put our information in bite-size pieces for the viewers to now overwhelm them and still inform them about our brand and its ambassadors, products, and viewpoints. <br>
		    <br>
		    On every page, the navigation bar stays the same together with the footer. In the footer, we want to remind the viewer of important information like contact information, where we are located, a CTA button to sign up for our newsletter, and useful social media (Instagram). We made sure this was consistent for the whole website for a cohesive user experience. For signing up with the newsletter we tried to make it as easy as possible for the viewer to sign up by having a text box to type the email in with a button underneath to make the steps as small as possible which will hopefully result in a higher percentage of people finishing this âtaskâ<br>
<br>
		    Across the whole website, we have made use of the âhover effectâ making the words or elements change color when hovering over it with the curser. We hope that this effect creates a more intuitive experience for our visitors while also giving more visual feedback which will create more engagement while also contributing to the aesthetics.<em> </em><br>
We also have responsive designs that make it easy for the user to change the width and height of the website or use it on a phone, for instance, on the standard websites three products are displayed next to each other. While on the phone these are underneath each other and you have to scroll down to see them all.<br>
<br>
		    We also have implemented multiple feedback mechanisms on our website. We did this by giving people confirmation messages when they contact us or when they signed up for the newsletter. With these feedback mechanisms, we hope to provide the confirmation that will cause people to feel confident while using our website.<br>
<br>
		    We organized our content intuitively and naturally by making use of a very familiar layout for websites. Also, we used headings and subheadings that should make navigating and reading through our website easier. With this, we created categories, which gave us the possibility to put more than one topic on our home/index page.<br><br>
<li><strong>Home/index page:</strong> <br><br>
For this page, we started with an eye-catching hero banner with a dog on it. With this, we immediately want to catch and draw attention to the text placed on it. On the top, we have our navigation bar and further information like where we are based and various ways of contacting us through phone, email, or social media. We put this at the top to be in reach quickly and to show various options at once. In the navigation bar underneath this, you can easily switch between the different pages and this is set up in a very intuitive and familiar way. This makes it very easy and natural for users to navigate through this bar. At the end of the bar, there is a search option that is located to make specific searches even easier.<br><br>Looking at our Information architecture a lot is going on on the home page. After the hero banner, we welcome the user and give them already a small introduction to our brand. We have a âlearn moreâ button located there click one that brings you to certain parts of the page where more information is on the specific topic. 

Underneath we have a welcome to waggies where we briefly introduce and mention our mission and vision. Underneath we have a carousel where we have short bits that show what kind of products we sell. The carousel gives it a playful look while also making it easier to look into a specific product. There is also a learn more button that navigates you to our product website.<br>If you scroll down we have a about us page where we tell about the origin of our company and how we see the future of Waggies. The read more button in this section brings you to our corporate page.<br>Further down our ambassadors are shown, we have these ambassadors to give a personal touch to our brand and build the trust of new and possibly uncertain customers.<br>The last part is testimonials, together with the ambassadors continue to create more trust while also showing quotes of experiences from previous and happy buyers.<br>At the bottom, sticking to a natural and familiar architecture we have to footer with shortcuts to all pages, our mission and vision, location, phone number, and an easy sign-up to our newsletter.<br><br><strong>Our products page:</strong><br>
Our products page has the same familiar heading and navigation bar to stick to the information architecture on the home page. Underneath this, we have a heading saying what type of product is underneath with a subheading to give a motivation to look into these products and their effects. Sticking to the already familiar design we have the products in rows of three on the website, this is the same as the ambassadors on the home page. When used on a phone the product will be in a row of one to make sure a clear picture is visible and the label is still readable. A darker add-to-cart button is underneath every product to make it accessible to add the products to the cart. To make sure this button is understood easily the text âAdd to cartâ is on the buttons.<br>When scrolling down further the familiar heading is back introducing another line of products. For these products, the same design choices are made to keep the page consistent and neat. The footer of all pages is the same and will also be displayed at the bottom of this page.
<br><br><strong>The Contact Us page:</strong>
<br>
For this page, we have the same familiar header and navigation bar, on the right as we have on all other pages. A big picture with a person on her phone with a dog laying next to her, we want to create a warm and good feeling. Since next to this is a fill-out form we want to ensure that the users who want to contact us feel comfortable. The picture stays next to this form as they fill it in to hopefully assure the user of the feeling. The footer is the same as all the other pages to again, continue with the already known style and architecture again.<br><br><strong>The cart page:</strong><br>
For this page, we have the same familiar header and navigation bar, on the right as we have on all other pages. Underneath is a heading saying âshopping cartâ with this it is clear that this is their shopping cart as this is seen after they add a product to their cart. The item, price, quantity, and total are in the top row with all suiting information in rows underneath depending on the amount of products ordered. On the right bottom under this table is a checkout button, we decided on this location so it feels very natural. The color of this button is yellow which grabs attention while also fitting in our color scheme and creating a more positive vibe.<br><br>

As mentioned in a specific analysis of the hierarchy and architecture of our pages we want to emphasize the importance of the consistency of all of our pages. We stay consistent with our header and footer, while also having certain design choices appear more often like boxes with pictures and text. We also have the colors from our house style, important colors like yellow and green stay consistent and prominent throughout our whole website.<br>
Especially on our home page, we took into account how important it is to have a good hierarchy, and we made sure that introductions would be at the top with more information about our products in the middle and reviews at the bottom. Considering this hierarchy is used a lot in website design that will hopefully create a more cohesive experience.
We also took into account the responsiveness of our website which will be likely used on both computers and phones. Regarding readability we looked into which colors from our house style would work best in certain backgrounds, for this reason, we mostly worked with basic colors like black and white for our typography while using brighter colors for our background.<br><br></li>
            <li><strong>How does your website design fit the values and personality of the brand?</strong> <br>
Our website design is a reflection of our brand's core values centered around creating happiness, fostering freedom, facilitating stress-free adventures, and celebrating happy dogs.

          <h4 id="production-3" class="mt-2">Testing Report</h4>
          <ul>
            <li> <strong>Testing Goals</strong> &ndash; The goal of testing our website WaggiesWebShop, was to see how our website was received by prospective clients, as well as making sure it was user friendly. We wanted to learn if a user was able to find everything that they would need to find to use our website. </li>
            <li> <strong>Testing Methods</strong>, We conducted the test with six different people, who were within our target audience. All of these testers have experience with dogs, either though their own, parental, family or friend relations. The testers are: 
              <ul>
                <li> <strong>Claudia Geelhoed</strong> Age 24</li>
                <li> <strong>Bente Fuit</strong> Age 19 </li>
                <li><strong>Annika Gabrielse</strong> Age 19</li>
				 <li> <strong>Noa van Bodegoem</strong> Age 20</li>
                <li> <strong>Ollie Lita</strong> Age 21</li>
                <li> <strong>Jesse van Baaren</strong> Age 21</li>
				<br> 
				  <p>The testing for our website was conducted both on a computer screen and on a Telephone screen. The Majority of the tests were conducted at the BUAS Campus, and one was conducted at Jesses house. <br>Some of the tasks provided in the testing protocol were: </p>
				<li> Can you please look through our home page and discover where the products page is</li>
                <li> What are some of the products that we offer?</li>
                <li>What is our mission at Waggies?</li>
				 <li> If you would have any questions about our company, or about the products that we offer, what would you do?</li>
                <li> If you have clicked on products in the products that you want to purchase, where would you go to find these items?</li>
                <li> We hope that you are more curious about our products and our company, so could you please look for our social media platform</li>
				<li> Can you find the anti-slip paw wax </li>
				 <li> How do you feel about the UI/UX design of our website? </li>
				  <li> Is there anything you would improve about the WaggiesWebshop website experience? </li>
				  <br> <p>These tests were recorded via iPhone and can be viewed here:<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aRBKKpW607V3Xip_nBLtnA2_LVVLp96A?usp=drive_link

</a> </p>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li> <strong>Testing Results</strong>
				<p>Before conducting our Usability Testing, we informed the participants of our awareness of some issues with our website. Particularly the Ambassador photos missing and photos from our testimonials. In addition to this, we informed them of the overlapping text with video situation in the big hero box on the index page. These issues are something that our group is struggling to figure out how to fix, as our files are correct both on our computer and on Git Hub, as well as there are no mistakes in our code. Despite this, we still conducted user testability to the best of our abilities. <br> <br> <strong>These are some of the positive aspects of UI/UX identified from our testing interview:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Clear Product Visibility: The participant was able to identify the products page on the homepage, indicating effective presentation and visibility of products.</li>
				 <li>Effective Communication of Vision/Mission:The participant accurately identified the company's vision and mission, indicating that this information is effectively communicated on the website.</li>
				 <li>Accessible Contact Options: The participant knew how to contact the company for inquiries through various channels, such as filling out a form, emailing, or calling, indicating accessible communication options.</li>
				 <li>Positive Feedback on Design Elements: The participant praised various design elements of the website, including the navigation bar, colors, slideshow of products, and readability of content.</li>
				  <br> <br><p><strong>These are some of the negative aspects of UI/UX identified from the testing interview</strong></p>
				  
                <li>UI/UX issues: The participant noted technical issues such as overlapping text and video, indicating potential problems with the website's display on certain devices or platforms</li>
				  <li>Unclear Product Presentation and product detail : Participants expressed confusion about where to find the products initially, suggesting a need for clearer presentation or labeling of product sections. The participants suggested that clicking on a product should provide more information or a larger image and the ability to add it to the cart, indicating a need for enhanced product presentation and functionality.</li>
				  <li>Issues with Photo Display: The participant noted issues with missing photos in sections like testimonials and ambassadors, suggesting potential problems with photo integration on the website.</li>
				  <li>Information Overload on Some Pages:  The participant felt that certain pages had too much information, particularly when contact options were duplicated, suggesting a need for better organization or consolidation of information.</li>
				  <li>Text Legibility: The participant mentioned difficulty reading some text due to light font color, indicating a need for improved text contrast for better readability.</li>
				  <li>Suggestion for Cart Icon: The participant suggested using an icon instead of the word "Cart" for better visual appeal and consistency with other design elements.</li>
				  <li>Spelling and Formatting Issues: The participant noted some spelling errors and inconsistent formatting on the website, suggesting the need for proofreading and consistency in design elements.</li>
				   <br><p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
				  <li>We would like to improve the responsiveness of the big hero box, so that it is responsive on a smaller screen, and doesnt remove the text. </li>
				  <li>In addition to this, for next time we would make it so that the products shown in the index page, were clickable, so it could take us directly to the products page. </li>
				  <li>We have improved spelling errors pointed out by testors, as well as some color correcting in certain areas of text. </li>
				  <li>If we had time, we would have liked to create a functioning cart.</li>
				  <li>On the corporate page, it looks like a lot of words are underlined, but despite our best efforts, were unable to remove this. This extends as well to the waggies webshop icon being the wrong color.

          <!-- End Production, start Marketing -->

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>Waggies campaign is about getting peopleâs attention and leading them to our website where we sell our calming essential oils, paw wax, and soaps for dogs, with our <em>target audience being</em>; Millennial dog owners, who are urban professionals, the two segments being double income no child, or high income with children and a dog. <em>Our message</em> to dog owners is that itâs possible to make their dogâs lives easier while also gaining more freedom for themselves. We conveyed this message by <em>executing promotional activities</em> through Instagram and TikTok. We posted videos, carousels, and stories on Instagram, and videos to TikToks, these followed trends to gain traction and awareness of our brand, and we shared our products, messages, and dog health tips.</p>
         
		  <p><strong>Our objectives included; </strong>By April 2024 we want to reach 2000 people/accounts via Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. At the end of the campaign we want to achieve 2000 views on at least 1 TikTok and 50 likes on one Instagram post.</p>
		   
		   <li>We picked Instagram, TikTok and Facebook as our platforms for promotion. Instagram and Facebook are popular amongst our target audience and TikTok is one of the fastest growing platforms in the world (TikTok Revenue and Usage Statistics (2024) - Business of Apps, 2024). There are also large dog owner communities on these apps that we can try to attract; #Dogsoftiktok has 31,7M posts, #DogsofInstagram has 319M posts. </li>
		  
          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p>We learned that it <em>takes more time</em> than we first thought. We wanted to post 3 Instagram posts and a week, one TikTok daily, and stories on the days we donât post, but with all the other classes going on and demanding our attention, we often forgot about this and didnât meet the goal.</p>
		  <p>We also struggled more with TikTok than expected, only after 9 TikTokâs we started gaining more than 800 views. Towards the end of the project we got our first TikTok with 1000+ views, making clear that our goal of 2000 views was set too high. Our most liked Instagram post got 34 likes, so we didnât reach our goal of 50 likes either. However throughout the process we discovered that we <em>set the bar too high</em>, so weâre still satisfied with the things we did manage to achieve so far.</p>
<p>We also planned on using Facebook as a platform, but we got locked out of it and we had to send in a picture to get it restored. By the time we got our account back it already was <em>too late to start a campaign on Facebook</em>. Were the campaign longer we definitely wouldâve used Facebook since itâs big among millennials.</p>
		  
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>If we were to continue the campaign, we would have to start by <em>reevaluating how realistic our content calendar</em> was, as we previously had both of our goals for reach, and the frequency of posting too high. We could adjust it so that it would become more realistic to execute (making sure to post regularly and not in a more spontaneous pattern), while remaining efficient for the Instagram and TikTok algorithms. We would be able to achieve this by making the posts and stories a week in advance, and using âAuto Publishâ on Instagram so that we wonât forget to post them ourselves.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;On TikTok, we learned that trend-hopping videos with green screen overlays did the most successful, so we would implement that into the content made for TikTok.
            As mentioned in the learning points, Facebook was initially going to be used, but due to some technical difficulties, we werenât able to use it. If we were to continue the campaign, we would set up our Facebook account, and connect it to our Instagram. This way whatever is posted to Instagram would also be posted to Facebook, saving usfrom having to make different posts. </p>
<p><strong>Our Planning would detail:</strong> Posting a story on Instagram every day, posting a TikTok 4 times a week (less frequently than the last planning), post a post to Instagram on Monday, Tuesday, and Friday between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m, and from midnight until 4 a.m (same as the last planning as they are the best days according to Sproutsocial, 2023). &nbsp;</p>

  </div>
</body>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Our goal </strong>and<strong> message</strong> for the campaign would remain the same as it has aligned with our brand well.</p>
			
		  <p><strong>Our objectives</strong> would be set for every 4 months (third) so that we can track the progress more frequently, to ensure we are evaluating and updating our methods when needed:&nbsp;</p>
			
			
			
		  <li>By August 2024 we want to reach 2000 people/accounts via <em>Instagram</em>, and to get an average of 20 likes per post.
            <ul>
              <li> We have reached 567 people in less than a month, so this should be attainable.</li>
            </ul>
</li>
		  <li>By August 2024, we want to reach a 28.5% engagement rate on our <em>Facebook page</em>.
            <ul>
              <li> The average is 28.3%, (We Analyzed 2,810 Pages to Calculate Average Facebook Engagement Rate, iconosquare, 2022).</li>
            </ul>
</li>
			<li>By August 2024, we aim to have reached 6500 people/accounts on <em>TikTok</em>.
              <ul>
                <li>With around 400 views per video, 4 times a week, for 4 months it gives a similar amount of people reached.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
			   
<h4 id="marketing-4" class="mt-4">Professionalism</h4>
          <p>Present and organize below all social media/online activities of the campaign. Context and material are according to the brand style, image, and vision. Images on the site are of high-quality, readable, and properly designed.</p>

<p><strong data_temp_dwid="0">Caption: </strong>ð¾ð± Did you know that ginger isnât just for humans? It can also benefit your furry friend! ð¶â¨Ginger is renowned for its therapeutic properties and can be a natural remedy for common ailments in dogs too. From soothing upset stomachs to easing joint pain, this spicy root has a lot to offer our canine companions!
Before adding ginger to your pupâs diet, here are a few things to keep in mind:
â Start with small amounts
â Opt for fresh or powdered ginger (not pickled!)
â Monitor for any adverse reactions
â Consult your vet, especially if your dog is on medication or has health conditions
Remember, moderation is key! Too much ginger can upset your dogâs stomach. Keep their treats to just 10% of their overall diet for optimal health and happiness. ð¾ð #waggies #gingerfordogs #Healthypup #dogwellness<br>

<p><strong data_temp_dwid="0">Caption: </strong>ð¾Introducing Lincoln, a spirited 6-year-old explorer who thrives on walks and thrilling adventures! ð¾ But, thereâs more to Lincolnâs storyâheâs still working through some fears. Loud scooters and mopeds make him jittery, and seeing dogs resembling the one from his puppyhood incident can stir up anxious barks. However, Lincolnâs owner has been his steadfast guide, using calming tools like essential oils and soothing music to ease his worries. With gentle reassurance and positive reinforcement, theyâre helping Lincoln see that itâs all good, one confident step at a time! ðð¶ #FearlessLincoln #CalmingJourney #PositivePup<br>

ð« Nutrient-Rich: They're like a natural multivitamin for your dog, promoting brain health, a healthy inflammatory response, heart function, weight loss, gut health, a healthy urinary tract, and eye function.
ð« Low in Sugar, High in Health: With low sugar content and fewer calories, blueberries make for a guilt-free treat that supports your pup's overall well-being. ð

<p><strong data_temp_dwid="0">Caption: </strong>Is your furry friend struggling with itchy paws and skin?
ð¾ Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV) might just be the solution!
Hereâs why:
ð¿ Anti-Inflammatory: Soothes irritation and reduces inflammation.
ð¦  Anti-Bacterial and Anti-Fungal: Naturally fights off bacteria and fungi.
ð¬ pH Balance: Restores the skinâs natural balance for less irritation.
ð¿ Topical Application: Dilute with water and spray onto itchy areas after baths.
ð ACV Bath: Add to bathwater for a soothing soak.
ð Internal Use: Some use in food, but topical application is often more effective.
Remember: Dilute ACV before use, and avoid open wounds or broken skin. Your pupâs comfort comes first! ð¶ð #waggies #DogHealth#AppleCiderVinegar #ItchyPawsRelief #healthypup<br>

<p><strong data_temp_dwid="0">Caption: </strong>ð¾ð Ever wonder why your pup seems to prefer certain colors when it comes to toys? ð¤
Well, dogs naturally gravitate towards blue and yellow, colors they can see best. ð¦ð¨
But hold on...why are so many toys in bright colors like red, orange, and green? ð It's simple: those colors are more appealing to us humans and easier for us to spot against backgrounds like grass.
Remember how we mentioned dogs have fewer cones in their retina, limiting their color processing abilities? ð¨ On the flip side, they have more rods, perfect for processing light.<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@waggies86/photo/7345047208150011168?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7310153151565563424" target="_blank">https://www.tiktok.com/@waggies86/photo/7345047208150011168?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7310153151565563424</a> <br>
